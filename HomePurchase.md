# House Purchase Story

You might get better advice online but here's my experience 

I'd take a read though https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/ if you haven't already 

I really valued looking at it from both sides:
* [Reasons to buy a house instead of renting](https://monevator.com/reasons-to-buy-a-house-instead-of-rentin/)
* [Reasons to rent a house instead of buying](https://monevator.com/reasons-to-rent-a-house-instead-of-buying/)

# What I did:

## Prework
Checked my credit rating as it is useful to have a good one for lending mortgages 

I use [Money Saving Expert Credit Club](https://clubs.moneysavingexpert.com/creditclub/) to keep an eye on mine Went to my bank's website and used their calculators

This gave me a good idea of how much I could afford (How much they would lend)

I plugged this into my finance spreadsheet to see what it would look like over 25 years

Remember to think about all the bills: 
* Council tax
* Maintenance
* Furniture
* Old roof
* Internet...

Once I had a general idea I applied for a mortgage in principle

This is an agreement that they'd give you a mortgage if you needed one

This is good to do as it lets you know if you will be lent the money you need 

Takes about an hour

## The Search

I had been looking at houses online anyway but with a 'Mortgage in principle' I could do that a bit more seriously as if I found somewhere I knew I could afford it and move forward with the purchase

Many weeks later I found one I liked the look of on Rightmove and went and viewed it 

The house market was moving quite fast so I basically had to make an offer that day 

You have to play a bit of a game here as the estate agents get paid a percentage so they want you to pay more 

You are also competing with other people so might need to take that into account 

I paid over asking price but I'll never know if I needed to or not

They accepted my offer

## The Paperwork

They asked if I had a mortgage arranged, I told them I had the 'mortgage in principle' but they suggested talking it though with a 'Mortgage Broker' 

A 'Mortgage Broker' can sometimes get rates and approvals that you as an individual can't, but they cost money and take a cut of the mortgage (Maybe worth it, maybe not) 

He took all my details, bank statements payslips, outgoings and plugged it into his database 

We discussed:
* Timescales (25/30 year mortgage) 
* Deposit amount (There are various bands that rates get better 90% LTV, 85%, 80% and so on)
* Fixed rate periods

He returned dozens of offers and we discussed the benefits of each, HSBC and Platform (The Coop) were cheapest for me (Fixed rate 1.6% for 5 years). At the same time he offered me a lot of extra stuff

Don't let them talk you into anything without going through it first

Life, Health, Buildings, Contents insurance, he couldn't beat the rates I had from my employer

It's considered good practice to have enough life insurance to pay off the mortgage worst comes to worst

I went along with him doing the mortgage application (I'm not sure it was really worth it as my bank were fairly close in rates)

I got my 'Mortgage Offer' from HSBC (and then TSB when it expired), which lasts for 6 months before you have to apply again

## Conveyancing

After the Mortgage is Approved your house purchase offer can move onto Conveyancers

They are a legal team/person who will carry out all the checks and red tape for you 

Drainage, flood, environment, title searches, fighting with the sellers solicitors the lot (Will cost me Â£2000 ish)

Stamp duty is coming back in so take that into account (First time buyers are exempt up to a limit)

They'll also handle your deposit and any HelpToBuy or LISA you might have 

Expect a lot of papers, forms and legal workings (edited)

## The Wait

With the rush for the stamp duty holiday, covid delaying probate (The previous owner died), and the sellers solicitors being bad at their jobs it's taken me 6 months and it's still not done...

None of this is fast

## Pulling out

You can pull out as a buyer all the way until exchange of contracts, it'll cost you all of the fees you have paid so far but not your deposit

If you have signed to buy the property they will take your deposit, so make sure you really want it before signing
