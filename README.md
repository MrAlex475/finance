### Spreadsheets
One of the most powerful tools in finance

What does mine include: 
* **Wage** - Pre and post Tax, Tax per Band, National Insurance, Student Loan. Did my employer or HMRC cock it up?
* **Bank Accounts** - Current accounts, investment accounts - Just a current standing and projected interest
* **Savings** - All the long term pre-retirement savings - LISA, Cash ISA, Stocks and Shares ISA
* **ShareCalc** - For when your monthly investments needs a spreadsheet to calculate how much of each fund to buy
* **Drawdown** - Estimates of spending the money saved such as ISA or pensions. Does it run out before I die?
* **Outgoings** - Bills - Mortgage/Rent, Council Tax, Season ticket, Average shopping, Insurance, Boiler Cover, Gas, Electric, Water, Internet
* **Budget** - A centralised analysis of all previous years. Is my spending going up, is lifestype creep in check?
* **Budget <year>** - A list of all purchases and spending with catergories to understand how much money is spent and what could be cut down
